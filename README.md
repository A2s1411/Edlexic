# Edlexic
Smart education to help dyslexic students.
We created an app which can be beneficial to all the dyslexic students and has the following functions:
1. Phonetic Dictionary with Text-to-Speech which helps the student for quick learning.
2. Colored pages to make it more accessible for the students to read.
3. Picture words to give them a better understanding of the topic.
4. Celebrations at every successful attempt to improve the studentâ€™s confidence.
